# Streaming Platform Project

A personal streaming platform inspired by Netflix, built with **React** and **Spring Boot**. This project is for learning and demonstration purposes — no actual movies are included for privacy reasons. Users can browse TV shows and movies, view details, and interact with content, while different user roles manage the platform with specific permissions.
